AI-Based Health Monitoring System

## Summary

This project aims to develop an AI-driven health monitoring system that helps users track vital signs, detect anomalies, and provide personalized health recommendations. It supports early diagnosis and improves healthcare accessibility.

## Background

Health monitoring is essential for early detection of diseases, yet many people lack access to regular checkups. This project addresses:
* Lack of accessible health monitoring tools for individuals in remote areas.
* Insufficient real-time tracking of vital signs.
* Overburdened healthcare systems, especially for routine checkups.

## How is it used?

The system can be used through a mobile app or wearable device. It continuously monitors vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels, and uses AI to detect abnormalities. Users receive alerts in case of critical conditions and can share data with healthcare providers for further analysis.

### Code Example

```python
def check_vitals(heart_rate, blood_pressure):
    normal_heart_rate = 60 <= heart_rate <= 100
    normal_blood_pressure = 90 <= blood_pressure[0] <= 120 and 60 <= blood_pressure[1] <= 80

    if normal_heart_rate and normal_blood_pressure:
        print("Vitals are normal.")
    else:
        print("Abnormal vitals detected! Consult a doctor.")
        
check_vitals(85, (115, 75))
